        \n\n\n<font color="#5078f2"><b>Matina Flood Watch</b></font> is an application that
        attempts to predict flood water levels in the different
        areas of Matina, Davao City in the event of flooding.
        Its predicting algorithm makes use of data gathered
        from the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and
        Astronomical Services Administration,
        the Davao City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office,
        and the Wunderground and OpenWeatherMap APIs. These gathered data were fed into a machine learning algorithm
        that produced the predicting algorithm for Matina Flood Watch.
        \n\nThis mobile application is a product of the undergraduate thesis, <font color="#5078f2"><i>A Mobile-based Urban
        Flooding Water Level Prediction Application Implementing Machine Learning Algorithms</i></font>, by
        <font color="#5078f2"> Chynna Sevilleno</font> and <font color="#5078f2">Ann-Louise Gaynor</font> of the Ateneo de Davao University under the mentorship
        of <font color="#5078f2">Michelle P. Banawan, Ph.D</font>.
